# Stable Release Pipeline for Python Environment Tools (PET)
# 
# This pipeline builds and publishes stable releases of the PET binary to the Azure Pipeline feed.
# It should only be triggered manually for stable releases and requires proper signing for security.
# The built artifacts are consumed by VS Code Python extension stable builds.

# Trigger Configuration - No automatic triggers, manual execution only
trigger: none
pr: none
# Should only ever be manually run for stable releases
