<!-- .LP -->
This extension provides arbitrary window and border shapes within the X11
protocol.
</para>
<para>
<!-- .LP -->
The restriction of rectangular windows within the X protocol is a significant
limitation in the implementation of many styles of user interface.  For
example, many transient windows would like to display a "drop shadow'' to
give the illusion of 3 dimensions.  As another example, some user interface
style guides call for buttons with rounded corners; the full simulation of a
nonrectangular shape, particularly with respect to event distribution and
cursor shape, is not possible within the core X protocol.  As a final
example, round clocks and nonrectangular icons are desirable visual addition
to the desktop.
</para>
<para>
<!-- .LP -->
This extension provides mechanisms for changing both the visible and interactive shape of a
window to arbitrary, possibly disjoint, nonrectangular forms.  The intent
of the extension is to supplement the existing semantics, not replace them.
In particular, it is desirable for clients that are unaware of the
extension to still be able to cope reasonably with shaped windows.  For
example, window managers should still be able to negotiate screen
real estate in rectangular pieces.  Toward this end, any shape specified for
a window is clipped by the bounding rectangle for the window as specified by
the window's geometry in the core protocol.  An expected convention would be
that client programs expand their shape to fill the area offered by the
window manager.
</para>
</chapter>

<chapter id="Description">
<title>Description</title>
<para>
Each window (even with no shapes specified) is defined by three regions:  the
<emphasis remap='I'>bounding region</emphasis>, the <emphasis remap='I'>clip
region</emphasis> and the <emphasis remap='I'>input region</emphasis>.  The
bounding region is the area of the
parent window that the window will occupy (including border). The clip region
is the subset of the bounding region that is available for subwindows and
graphics.  The area between the bounding region and the clip region is defined
to be the border of the window. The input region is the subset of the
bounding region that can "contain" the pointer.
</para>

<para>
A nonshaped window will have a bounding region that is a rectangle
spanning the window, including its border; the clip region will be a rectangle
filling the inside dimensions (not including the border); the input
region will match the bounding region.  In this document,
these areas are referred to as the
<emphasis remap='I'>default bounding region</emphasis>, the
<emphasis remap='I'>default clip region</emphasis> and the
<emphasis remap='I'>default input region</emphasis>.  For a window with inside
size of <emphasis remap='I'>width</emphasis> by
<emphasis remap='I'>height</emphasis> and border width
<emphasis remap='I'>bwidth</emphasis>, the default bounding, clip
and input regions are the rectangles (relative to the window origin):
</para>

<literallayout class="monospaced">
bounding.x = -<emphasis remap='I'>bwidth</emphasis>
bounding.y = -<emphasis remap='I'>bwidth</emphasis>
bounding.width = <emphasis remap='I'>width</emphasis> + 2 * <emphasis remap='I'>bwidth</emphasis>
bounding.height = <emphasis remap='I'>height</emphasis> + 2 * <emphasis remap='I'>bwidth</emphasis>

clip.x = 0
clip.y = 0
clip.width = <emphasis remap='I'>width</emphasis>
clip.height = <emphasis remap='I'>height</emphasis>

input.x = -<emphasis remap='I'>bwidth</emphasis>
input.y = -<emphasis remap='I'>bwidth</emphasis>
input.width = <emphasis remap='I'>width</emphasis> + 2 * <emphasis remap='I'>bwidth</emphasis>
input.height = <emphasis remap='I'>height</emphasis> + 2 * <emphasis remap='I'>bwidth</emphasis>
</literallayout>

<para>
This extension allows a client to modify any combination of the bounding,
clip or input regions by specifying new regions that combine with the default
regions.  These new regions are called the
<emphasis remap='I'>client bounding region</emphasis>,
the <emphasis remap='I'>client clip region</emphasis> and the
<emphasis remap='I'>client input region</emphasis>.  They are specified
relative to the origin of
the window and are always defined by offsets relative to the window origin
(that is, region adjustments are not required when the window is moved).
Three mechanisms for specifying regions are provided:  a list of rectangles,
a bitmap, and an existing bounding or clip region from a window.  This is
modeled on the specification of regions in graphics contexts in the core
protocol and allows a variety of different uses of the extension.
</para>

<para>
When using an existing window shape as an operand in specifying a new shape,
the client region is used, unless none has been set, in which case the
default region is used instead.
</para>

<para>
The <emphasis remap='I'>effective bounding region</emphasis> of a window
is defined to be the intersection of
the client bounding region with the default bounding region.  Any portion of
the client bounding region that is not included in the default bounding
region will not be included in the effective bounding region on the screen.
This means that window managers (or other geometry managers) used to dealing
with rectangular client windows will be able to constrain the client to a
rectangular area of the screen.
</para>

<para>
Construction of the effective bounding region is dynamic; the client bounding
region is not mutated to obtain the effective bounding region.  If a client
bounding region is specified that extends beyond the current default bounding
region, and the window is later enlarged, the effective bounding region will
be enlarged to include more of the client bounding region.
</para>

<para>
The <emphasis remap='I'>effective clip region</emphasis> of a window is defined to be the intersection of the
client clip region with both the default clip region and the client bounding
region.  Any portion of the client clip region that is not included in both
the default clip region and the client bounding region will not be included in
the effective clip region on the screen.
</para>

<para>
Construction of the effective clip region is dynamic; the client clip region is
not mutated to obtain the effective clip region.  If a client clip region is
specified that extends beyond the current default clip region and the
window or its bounding region is later enlarged, the effective clip region will
be enlarged to include more of the client clip region if it is included in
the effective bounding region.
</para>

<para>
The border of a window is defined to be the difference between the effective
bounding region and the effective clip region.  If this region is empty, no
border is displayed.  If this region is nonempty, the border is filled
using the border-tile or border-pixel of the window as specified in the core
protocol.  Note that a window with a nonzero border width will never be able
to draw beyond the default clip region of the window.  Also note that a zero
border width does not prevent a window from having a border, since the clip
shape can still be made smaller than the bounding shape.
</para>

<para>
All output to the window and visible regions of any subwindows will be
clipped to the effective clip region.  The server must not retain window
contents beyond the effective bounding region with backing store.  The window's
origin (for graphics operations, background tiling, and subwindow placement)
is not affected by the existence of a bounding region or clip region.
</para>

<para>
The <emphasis remap='I'>effective input region</emphasis> of a window is
defined to be the intersection of the
client input region with both the default input region and the client bounding
region.  Any portion of the client input region that is not included in both
the default input region and the client bounding region will not be included in
the effective input region on the screen.
</para>
<para>
<!-- .LP -->
Construction of the effective input region is dynamic; the client input region is
not mutated to obtain the effective input region.  If a client input region is
specified that extends beyond the current default input region and the
window or its bounding region is later enlarged, the effective input region will
be enlarged to include more of the client input region if it is included in
the effective bounding region.
</para>
<para>
<!-- .LP  -->
Areas that are inside the default bounding region but outside the effective
bounding region are not part of the window; these areas of the screen will
be occupied by other windows.  Input events that occur within the default
bounding region but outside the effective bounding region will be delivered as
if the window was not occluding the event position.  Events that occur in
a nonrectangular border of a window will be delivered to that window, just
as for events that occur in a normal rectangular border.
</para>
<para>
<!-- .LP -->
An
<function>InputOnly</function>
window can have its bounding or input region set, but it is a
<function>Match</function>
error to attempt to set a clip region on an
<function>InputOnly</function>
window or to specify its clip region as a source to a request
in this extension.
</para>
<para>
<!-- .LP -->
The server must accept changes to the clip and input regions of a root window, but
the server is permitted to ignore requested changes to the bounding region
of a root window.  If the server accepts bounding region changes, the contents
of the screen outside the bounding region are implementation dependent.

<para>
This request specifies an array of rectangles, relative to the origin of the
window plus the specified offset (xOff and yOff) that together
define a region.  This region is combined (as specified by the operator
op) with the existing client region (specified by destKind) of the
destination window, and the result is stored as the specified client region of
the destination window.  Note that the list of rectangles can be empty,
specifying an empty region; this is not the same as passing
<function>None</function> to
<function>ShapeMask</function>,
</para>

<para>
If known by the client,
ordering relations on the rectangles can be specified with the ordering
argument.
This may provide faster operation by the server.
The meanings of the ordering values are the same as in the core protocol
<function>SetClipRectangles</function>
request.
If an incorrect ordering is specified,
the server may generate a
<function>Match </function>
error, but it is not required to do so.
If no error is generated,
the graphics results are undefined.
Except for
<function>UnSorted ,</function>
the rectangles should be nonintersecting, or the resulting region will
be undefined.
<function>UnSorted </function>
means that the rectangles are in arbitrary order.
<function>YSorted </function>
means that the rectangles are nondecreasing in their Y origin.
<function>YXSorted </function>
additionally constrains
<function>YSorted </function>
order in that all rectangles with an equal Y origin are
nondecreasing in their X origin.
<function>YXBanded </function>
additionally constrains
<function>YXSorted </function>
by requiring that, for every possible Y scanline,
all rectangles that include that scanline have identical Y origins and Y
extents.

<para>
Whenever the client bounding, clip or input shape of a window is modified, a
<function>ShapeNotify</function>
event is sent to each client that has used
<function>ShapeSelectInput</function>
to request it.
</para>

<para>
Kind indicates which client region (bounding or clip) has been modified;
shaped is
<function>True</function>
when the window has a client shape of type kind, and is
<function>False</function>
when the window no longer has a client shape of this type.
The x, y, width, and height indicate the extents of the
current shape.  When shaped is
<function>False</function>
these will indicate the extents of the default region.  The timestamp
indicates the server time when the shape was changed.
